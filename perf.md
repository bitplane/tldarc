# Performance Comparison: CDX Domain Extraction

Testing with CC-MAIN-2008-2009 cdx-00000.gz (307MB compressed)

| Approach | Speed | Real Time | User Time | Sys Time | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Original sed (regex) | ~0.65 MB/s | - | - | - | Complex regex with backreferences |
| Cut pipeline (9 stages) | 39.6 MB/s | 7.9s | 29.8s | 8.9s | 9 pipes: cut/tr chain |
| Cut + awk pipeline | 8.2 MB/s | 37.7s | 41.9s | 2.7s | Awk for final formatting |
| Optimized sed | 2.2 MB/s | 142s | 146.8s | 2.4s | Simpler regex, \L for lowercase |
| C program | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Direct byte scanning |

## Analysis

- **Cut pipeline wins** for shell-based solutions despite high system overhead from pipes
- Pipeline parallelism (multiple cores) outweighs pipe overhead
- Regex is the bottleneck in sed approaches, even with optimization
- Awk's interpreted nature makes it slower than multiple cut processes
- High sys time in cut pipeline (8.9s) is from pipe communication between 9 processes

## Recommendations

1. For pure shell: Use the cut/tr pipeline
2. For maximum speed: Use the C program
3. Decompression: pigz/zstd give ~30% improvement over gzip
4. Further optimization: Process multiple files in parallel
